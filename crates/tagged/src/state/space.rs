//! A Space is like a magic folder that's shared between members.
//!
//! There are two kinds of spaces, Owned (invite-only), and Communal
//! (open to anyone). You can be a member of more than one space, and
//! you can have more than one Profile.
//!
//! You can imagine that each Profile that's a member of a space has its
//! own dedicated home directory. You and your apps read and write in
//! your profile's home directory. You can also give other profiles the
//! ability to read and write to your choice of subdirectories in the form
//! of capabilities.
//!
//! Apps are effectively an interface to viewing data.
//!
//! - A photo album is just a list of files rendered as a grid
//! - A calendar is just a list of events, rendered on a week or month view
//! - A chat is just a list of messages and media, rendered as a conversation
